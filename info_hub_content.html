                    <h3>Understanding BMI: What It Is and Why It Matters</h3>
                    <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used measure calculated from your height and weight. It provides a simple way to categorize weight status – underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese – and helps estimate body fatness. While BMI doesn't measure body fat directly and has limitations (e.g., it doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat), it's a valuable screening tool for potential weight-related health risks like heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Understanding your BMI category is a first step towards assessing your health status and making informed decisions about your lifestyle.</p>

                    <h3>The BMI, Nutrition, and Fitness Triangle</h3>
                    <p>Maintaining a healthy BMI isn't just about the number; it's about the balance between nutrition and physical activity. A balanced diet provides the essential nutrients and energy your body needs without excess calories, while regular exercise helps burn calories, build muscle, and improve overall cardiovascular health. Focusing on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, combined with consistent physical activity tailored to your fitness level (as suggested by our tool!), creates a synergistic effect that supports a healthy weight and reduces health risks.</p>

                    <h3>Debunking Common Weight & Health Myths</h3>
                    <p>Navigating health advice can be confusing! Let's clear up some common misconceptions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> All calories are created equal. <strong>Fact:</strong> While calorie count matters, the *source* of calories is crucial. Nutrient-dense foods offer more health benefits than processed foods with empty calories.</li>
                        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Carbs make you gain weight. <strong>Fact:</strong> Carbohydrates are essential fuel. Focus on complex carbs (whole grains, vegetables) over refined ones (sugary drinks, white bread). Portion control is key.</li>
                        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> You need to exercise intensely for hours to see benefits. <strong>Fact:</strong> Consistency is more important than intensity, especially when starting. Even moderate activity like brisk walking offers significant health benefits.</li>

                    <h3>Diet and Exercise Best Practices</h3>
                    <p>Achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle involves sustainable habits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Balanced Diet:</strong> Prioritize whole foods, control portion sizes, stay hydrated, and limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive saturated fats.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities twice a week. Find activities you enjoy!</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency & Patience:</strong> Healthy changes take time. Focus on making small, sustainable adjustments rather than drastic, short-term fixes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Rest when needed and don't push through pain during exercise.</li>
                    </ul>
