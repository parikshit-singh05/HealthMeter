# HealthMeter

HealthMeter is a comprehensive web application designed to help users monitor and improve their health through interactive tools and educational resources. The platform offers BMI calculation, calorie tracking, personalized exercise suggestions, and an extensive health information hub, all within an intuitive and responsive interface.

## Features

### BMI Calculator
The BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator allows users to input their height and weight to receive an immediate calculation of their BMI value. Results include the numerical BMI score, weight category classification (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese), and a brief explanation of what the result means for their health. This feature serves as a simple first step in understanding one's current health status.

### Calorie Counter
The integrated calorie counter enables users to track their daily food intake by searching for and logging food items from a pre-populated database. Each entry displays the food name, quantity, and associated calorie content. Users can add multiple items throughout the day, remove entries as needed, and view a running total of their calorie consumption. This tool helps users maintain awareness of their nutritional intake and supports dietary planning.

### Personalized Exercise Suggestions
Based on the user's BMI calculation, HealthMeter provides tailored exercise recommendations categorized by fitness level (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced). These suggestions are specifically designed to address the health needs associated with different weight categories, offering appropriate activities, intensity levels, and progression paths. All recommendations include important safety disclaimers to encourage consultation with healthcare professionals.

### Health Information Hub
The Health Hub section offers educational content covering various aspects of health and wellness. Articles include detailed explanations of BMI and its significance, the relationship between nutrition and fitness, common health myths with factual corrections, and best practices for diet and exercise. This knowledge base helps users make informed decisions about their health journey beyond just the numbers.

### Additional Features
- Responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices
- User testimonials highlighting positive experiences with the platform
- Newsletter subscription option for users to receive regular health tips and updates
- Clean, intuitive interface with a health-focused color scheme and layout
